* **Vue Router 4:** Client-side routing.
* **Axios:** (Present for future backend integration/mocking).
* **PyQt5** (This seems like a leftover from the previous project you shared, if it's not used in this Vue project, remove it. I'll keep it out for now as the `package.json` doesn't indicate it.)
* **Node.js (v14.x / v16.x LTS recommended):** Runtime environment and build tools.
* **Vue CLI 4.x:** Project tooling.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS v14.x or v16.x recommended) and npm.
    * *Tip:* Use a Node Version Manager (e.g., [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) to easily switch Node.js versions.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd grab-easy
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
